# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 1000 words).

The following artwork is a representation of an inevitable future. Although the future cannot be
predicted. It can be estimated. The artwork, '2118' is named after the year it takes place. Approximately, 100 years in the future.
The grand challenge, "The ANU Asteroid Mining Mission", seems like an outcome that will be accomplished sometime in the future.
As the professor in the video mentioned that the Grand challenge poses a problem which is multi disciplinary in nature. In my eyes the
grand challenge gave me an opportunity to predict the future.

The entire experience has been structured in 3 ways. All these individual structures are contrasting to one another.
To an untrained eye they will more or less seem the same. But if the user takes time to truly understand the artwork,
they will see the subtleties play out. From the littlest things such as the positioning of certain text, to a reversal in colour.
To bigger changes such as clashing personalities, and conflicting ideas are divided and then layered. The user interacts with a
total of three scenarios, namely (Earth(South Australia), Space, Mars). Each area has a unique personality and feature set.

At the end of the artwork, I would like the users to feel that the future isn't a utopia or a dystopia.
It is more or less just the same as the present. It will continue to contain problems big or small, just as present.

Therefore, I would like them to think that the future is in there hands, not anyone else's.
The future is what they make of it.

Hopefully, they will pass on this idea to there family and friends.
